            Greetings! My name is Lauren. I am from St. Simons Island, Georgia. My New Year’s resolution includes ice fishing, 
            watching ten movies from countries I’ve never seen before, and doing the splits. I like going on roadtrips with my dad. 
            My favorite places to go are South Dakota and California. Perhaps this year I will go ice fishing with my Uncle in South
            Dakota towards the colder months. This will be convenient as I am a pescatarian, meaning I abstain from eating all meats 
            except for fish. I want to watch more Westerns this summer. One of the best movies ever is,"The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly." 
            Clint Eastwood is so cool and awesome. I also really like Paul McCartney; I just think he is so splendid. I hope to meet him 
            one day and give him a nice, firm handshake. I like to wear red and navy. I do that a lot.
