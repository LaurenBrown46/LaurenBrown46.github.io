    <p>The Brothers Karamazov is a murder mystery, a courtroom drama, 
        and an exploration of erotic rivalry in a series of triangular love affairs
        involving the “wicked and sentimental” Fyodor Pavlovich Karamazov and his three 
        sons―the impulsive and sensual Dmitri; the coldly rational Ivan; and the healthy, 
        red-cheeked young novice Alyosha. Through the gripping events of their story, 
        Dostoevsky portrays the whole of Russian life, is social and spiritual striving,
        in what was both the golden age and a tragic turning point in Russian culture.</p>

    <p>As Walter Kaufmann, one of the world's leading authorities on Nietzsche,
         notes in his introduction, "Few writers in any age were so full of ideas," and 
         few writers have been so consistently misinterpreted. The Portable Nietzsche 
         includes Kaufmann's definitive translations of the complete and unabridged texts 
         of Nietzsche's four major works: Twilight of the Idols, The Antichrist, Nietzsche 
         Contra Wagner and Thus Spoke Zarathustra. In addition, Kaufmann brings together 
         selections from his other books, notes, and letters, to give a full picture of
          Nietzsche's development, versatility, and inexhaustibly.</p>

    <p>Exerting its influence on the relationship of art and obscenity, it is one of the 
        books that redefined not just literature but American culture. For the Burroughs 
        enthusiast and the neophyte, this volume—that contains final-draft typescripts, 
        numerous unpublished contemporaneous writings by Burroughs, his own later 
        introductions to the book, and his essay on psychoactive drugs—is a valuable 
        and fresh experience of a novel that has lost none of its relevance or satirical bite.</p>

    <p>Andre Gregory is an intense, highly experimental theater director and playwright in 
        search of life's meanings and spiritual revelations. His friend, Wally Shawn, is an 
        actor and playwright living in New York who is more preoccupied with the search for 
        his next meal. As Andre recounts his global journeys involving esoteric theatrical 
        experiments and mystical adventures, Wally listens with more than skepticism, as his 
        attitudes shift among wonder, puzzlement, admiration, and anger. What finally emerges 
        is a sensitive portrait of a friendship that survives and transcends contransting 
        assumptions about love, death, art, and man's continuing quest for self-fulfillment.</p>

    <p>Spanning sixty-four years―from his early days in Liverpool, through the historic decade of 
        The Beatles, to Wings and his solo career―Paul McCartney’s The Lyrics revolutionized the

    <p>Martin Scorsese's challenging and often controversial films are a record of the most personal achievement in 
        modern American cinema. Mean Streets, Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, Gooodfellas--these titles conjure up a world and 
        a style of filmmaking that he has made his own, one of a savage beauty of great intensity and truth.
        The interviews which make up this book chart the journey that Scorsese has taken across the years in search of 
        new subjects to engage and absorb him, and in the process reveal a man who, like Michael Powell and Francios 
        Truffaut, has an unbridled passion for film--a passion which is evident in every frame of his work.</p>

    <p>Ryünosuke Akutagawa is one of Japan's foremost stylists—a modernist master whose short stories are marked by highly original imagery, 
        cynicism, beauty and wild humour. "Rashömon"and "In a Bamboo Grove" inspired Kurosawa's magnificent film and depict a past in which 
        morality is turned upside down, while tales such as "The Nose," "O-Gin" and "Loyalty" paint a rich and imaginative picture of a 
        medieval Japan peopled by Shoguns and priests, vagrants and peasants. And in later works such as "Death Register," "The Life of a 
        Stupid Man," and "Spinning Gears," Akutagawa drew from his own life to devastating effect, revealing his intense melancholy and 
        terror of madness in exquisitely moving impressionistic stories.

    <p>Published shortly after his death, the Ethics is undoubtedly Spinoza's greatest work - an elegant, fully cohesive cosmology derived from
         first principles, providing a coherent picture of reality, and a guide to the meaning of an ethical life. Following a logical 
         step-by-step format, it defines in turn the nature of God, the mind, the emotions, human bondage to the emotions, and the power 
         of understanding - moving from a consideration of the eternal, to speculate upon humanity's place in the natural order, the nature 
         of freedom and the path to attainable happiness. </p>

    <p>In 1572 Montaigne retired to his estates in order to devote himself to leisure, reading and reflection. 
        There he wrote his constantly expanding 'assays', inspired by the ideas he found in books contained in
         his library and from his own experience. He discusses subjects as diverse as war-horses and cannibals,
          poetry and politics, sex and religion, love and friendship, ecstasy and experience. But, above all,
           Montaigne studied himself as a way of drawing out his own inner nature and that of men and women in 
           general. The Essays are among the most idiosyncratic and personal works in all literature and provide 
           an engaging insight into a wise Renaissance mind, continuing to give pleasure and enlightenment to 
           modern readers.</p>

    <p>Following the discovery of her archive in a thrift auction house in 2007, Vivian Maier's posthumous
        trajectory from relative obscurity to one of the great American photographers of the twentieth century
         is the story of a singular talent. From the mid-1950s throughout her adult life, she worked as a nanny 
         in New York City and Chicago. During this time, she created a huge body of photographs and films recording 
         everyday street life, often including self-portraits and moments of fleeting reflection within the cityscape,
          and earning her comparisons to Helen Levitt, Robert Frank, and Diane Arbus. This new addition to the Photofile 
          series is a succinct and essential overview of Maier's work, and a fascinating window into American life.</p>

    <p>Written when Engels was only twenty-four, and inspired in particular by his time living amongst the poor in 
        Manchester, this forceful polemic explores the staggering human cost of the Industrial Revolution in 
        Victorian England. Engels paints an unforgettable picture of daily life in the new industrial towns, and 
        for miners and agricultural workers--depicting overcrowded housing, abject poverty, child labour, sexual 
        exploitation, dirt and drunkenness--in a savage indictment of the greed of the bourgeoisie.</p>

    <p>From his first visit to Russia in 1898 until his death in 1949 as the Cold War began to flower, the life of Sir
         Bernard Pares and Russia were intimately linked. Although banned from the country until 1935 by the communist
          government because of his involvement with the White Army, he wrote extensively on Russian history and literature 
          and on his personal experiences. A 1968 retrospective article about him describes him as more of a publicist and 
          promoter of comprehensive Russian studies than a true research scholar. As in the apple not falling far from the tree, 
          his son Richard was also an eminent historian, pursuing an interest in the West Indies.</p>

    <p>First published in 1973, this is a study of the force of photographic images which are continually inserted between 
        experience and reality. Sontag develops further the concept of 'transparency'. When anything can be photographed and
         photography has destroyed the boundaries and definitions of art, a viewer can approach a photograph freely with no

    <p>The first, shortest, and most approachable of James Joyce’s novels, A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man portrays the Dublin 
        upbringing of Stephen Dedalus, from his youthful days at Clongowes Wood College to his radical questioning of all convention. 
        In doing so, it provides an oblique self-portrait of the young Joyce himself. At its center lie questions of origin and source, 
        authority and authorship, and the relationship of an artist to his family, culture, and race. Exuberantly inventive in style, 
        the novel subtly and beautifully orchestrates the patterns of quotation and repetition instrumental in its hero’s quest to create 
        his own character, his own language, life, and art: “to forge in the smithy of my soul the uncreated conscience of my race.”</p>

    <p>How four of Europe's most mysterious and fascinating writers shaped the modern mind.Dostoevsky, Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, and Kafka 
        were all outsiders in their societies, unable to fit into the accepted nineteenth-century categories of theology, philosophy, or 
        belles lettres. Instead, they saw themselves both as the end products of a dying civilization and as prophets of the coming chaos
         of the twentieth century. In this brilliant combination of biography and lucid exposition, their apocalyptic visions of the future

    <p>François Truffaut (1932-1984), perhaps the most respected member of the New Wave group of French moviemakers, left a legacy of 
        beloved and influential films that include The 400 Blows, Jules and Jim, Stolen Kisses, Day for Night and The Story of Adele H. 
        Equally fascinating is the very large body of film criticism Truffaut wrote over many years for Cahiers du Cinema and other 
        leading film journals. Wonderfully varied, personal, and informal, these reviews all communicate unabashed love for and an 
        enormous excitement about the movies. The Films in My Life is Truffaut's own selection of more than one hundred essays that 
        range widely over the history of film and pay tribute to Truffaut's particular heroes, among them Hitchcock, Welles, Chaplin, 
        Renoir, Cocteau, Bergman, and Buñuel.</p>

    <p>Frank O'Connor's "The Mad Lomasneys and Other Stories" offers a vivid and insightful glimpse into Irish life, particularly 
        in his native Cork. The collection showcases O'Connor's mastery of the short story form, presenting a range of characters 
        and situations that are both distinctly Irish and universally resonant. Through a blend of sharp wit, gentle irony, and
        deep psychological understanding, he explores the complexities of human relationships, family dynamics, and the subtle 
        interplay between individual desires and societal expectations, often touching on themes of love, resentment, and the 
        search for meaning in everyday struggles.</p>

    <p>This book contains two separate stories: "Raise High the Roof Beam, Carpenters" is the first, and "Seymour: An Introduction" is 
        the second. "Raise High the Roof Beam, Carpenters" is a story about the Glass family, narrated by Buddy, the second oldest brother. 
        Buddy is attending his brother Seymour's wedding to a gal named Muriel, but he's on Army leave during active duty in World War II.
        At the wedding, everyone is stunned when Seymour does not show up. The action of the story picks up when several characters end
         up carpooling together following the failed wedding. The others (the Matron of Honor and her husband, and a couple of stragglers) 
         are talking about Seymour and the disappointment of his not showing up, and Buddy never tells them that he is secretly Seymour's 
         brother, so they talk more openly with him than they otherwise would.

    <p>Men Without Women" was a milestone in Hemingway's career. "Fiesta" had already established him as a novelist of exceptional 
        power, but with these short stories, his second collection, he showed that it is possible, within the space of a few pages,
         to recreate a scene with absolute truth, bringing to life details observed only by the eye of a uniquely gifted artist.
          Hemingway's men are bullfighters and boxers, hired hands and hard drinkers, gangsters and gunmen. Each of their stories
           deals with masculine toughness unsoftened by woman's hand. Incisive, hard-edged, pared down to the bare minimum, they 
           are classic Hemingway territory.</p>

    <p>From charity to deceit, benevolence to violence, fear of God to extreme cruelty, the dictator of The Autumn of the 
        Patriarch embodies the best and the worst of human nature. Gabriel García Márquez, the renowned master of magical 
        realism, vividly portrays the dying tyrant caught in the prison of his own dictator-ship. Employing an innovative,

    <p>Walter Rodney’s The Russian Revolution collects surviving texts from a series of lectures he delivered at the 
        University of Dar es Salaam, an intellectual hub of the independent Third World. It had been his intention to 
        work these into a book, a goal completed posthumously with the editorial aid of Robin D.G. Kelley and Jesse Benjamin.
         Moving across the historiography of the long Russian Revolution with clarity and insight, Rodney transcends the 
         ideological fault lines of the Cold War. Surveying a broad range of subjects—the Narodniks, social democracy, 
         the October Revolution, civil war, and the challenges of Stalinism—Rodney articulates a distinct viewpoint 
         from the Third World, one that grounds revolutionary theory and history with the people in motion.</p>

    <p>In Either/Or, using the voices of two characters—the aesthetic young man of part one, called simply "A," and 
        the ethical Judge Vilhelm of the second section—Kierkegaard reflects upon the search for a meaningful existence, 
        contemplating subjects as diverse as Mozart, drama, boredom, and, in the famous Seducer's Diary, the cynical 
        seduction and ultimate rejection of a young, beautiful woman. A masterpiece of duality, Either/Or is a brilliant
         exploration of the conflict between the aesthetic and the ethical - both meditating ironically and seductively
          upon Epicurean pleasures, and eloquently expounding the noble virtues of a morally upstanding life.

         many by the few, but also shows humanity’s capacity for compassion and hope. Etienne Lantier, an unemployed railway worker, 
         is a clever but uneducated young man with a dangerous temper. Forced to take a back-breaking job at Le Voreux mine when

        Street in New Orleans, who between gigantic seizures of flatulence and eructations is filling dozens of Big Chief tablets with 
        invective.</p>
